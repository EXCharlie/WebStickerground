# WebStickerground  |  A Vibrant Senior High School Message Wall

Welcome to [WebStickerground](https://excharlie.github.io/WebStickerground/) — a dynamic, interactive message wall crafted specifically for senior high school students, built with the Vue framework. 

Whether you're a current student, a graduate reminiscing about your school days, or someone curious about the ups and downs of teenage life, WebStickerground invites you to dive into these candid, unpolished, and deeply human notes. It’s not just a project — it’s a time capsule of youth.

> The story continues to unfold, and we remain the ones holding the pen.

> 故事依然在书写，而我们始终是拥有执笔权的人。
